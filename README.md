Basic project in AngularJS w/ Firebase.io/AngularFire. 

App allows a user to input an item name, url, their name, and priority for planning purposes. Potential for sharing shopping needs between spouses/groups. Example:

John and Jane are a couple who share shopping responsibilites. Jane needs a new computer monitor in the next few days. John needs a new set of tires for his car in the next few weeks. Both enter their future purchases, as well as the URL and priority. Now both can see the items they'll need to budget for soon.
