# WishList App

Basic project in AngularJS w/ Firebase.io/AngularFire. App allows users to input an item name, url, your name, and priority. Potential for sharing shopping needs between spouses/groups. Based on an idea I've had for my wife and I to use, as it's difficult to know what items the other person might need that aren't urgent/needs (vs wants).
